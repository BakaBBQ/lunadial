# Luna Dial
Touhou 2d fighting game for fun in clojure via play-clj.

Currently using th135 assets for prototyping.

Has a interesting way of handling states, you might want to check out
logic.clj.

##Notables
Since the assets come from th135, they take up 100MB+ room.
Therefore I left all the assets out just for simplicity.

##License
the code itself is distributed under the MIT license,
see the license file for more details.
